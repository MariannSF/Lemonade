Created a lemonade maker application

First you are presented with an image of a lemon tree, to choose the lemon to make lemonade tap on the image 
2nd you need to squeeze the lemons by tapping on the image where the number of taps defined by a random number between 1 and 3 
then in order to drink the lemonade again tap on image to have your glass empty and prompted if you like to make another lemonade tap on image 

As you probably guessed this is a  basic application where i have practiced different features in kotlin using jetpack compose
